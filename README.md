# Project: using LLMs to write SPises

Since LLMs are so smart, we wonder how good they are for generating 'formal' specifications. Or at least, specifications that can be executed so we can actually use them for checking the inputs and outputs of programs under test.

In the current study we look into both commercial LLMs like OpenAI GPT as well open source LLMs for writing specifications in the form of pre- and post-conditions.

On simple-specs, N=30 involving simple predicates on number-arithmetics, logical relations, and quantifiers.

Example prompt-1: _Give a Python program `Postcondition(x,y,z)` that checks whether the sum of x and y is zero or equal to z_

Answer by Orca-mini-3B: ðŸ˜…

```python
Postcondition(x,y,z):
     if x + y == 0 or x - y == 0 or z - x == 0:
     return True
     else:
     return False
```

Example prompt-2: _Give a Python program `Postcondition(joke:str)` that checks whether the joke is funny._ ðŸ˜‰

Answer by OpenAI's GPT:

```python
def Postcondition(joke: str) -> bool:
    # Use VADER for a basic sentiment analysis approach
    sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
    sentiment = sia.polarity_scores(joke)

    # Consider a joke "funny" if it has a positive sentiment
    if sentiment['pos'] > sentiment['neg']:
        return True
    return False

# Example usage
joke = "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!"
print(Postcondition(joke))  # Output: True
```
