# My LLM Project

#### Using GPT4All.

You can use a [Docker-image with GPT4All installed](https://hub.docker.com/r/morgaine/llm4spi). The image has:

* Ubuntu 22-04
* Python 3.12 installed
* NVIDIA Container Toolkit installed
* Vulkan SDK installed
* GPT4All installed (as a Python package)

### Other notes

Interesting case with HE99 pre-cond:

(1) The string s represents a number. --> GPT 3.5 has a problem in translating this correctly
(2) The string s must represent a number. --> GPT 3.5 suddenly can translate this correctly
